# Multi-class Weather Classification with Artificial Neural Networks
## Machine Learning Course Project


The aim of this project is to use Artificial Neural Networks (in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) to learn a function that detects the weather conditions in a picture (SUNNY, RAINY, SNOWY, HAZE) .
Having a large data set of rgb pictures classified by the weather condition, the problem has been solved in two ways:
- I defined the architecture and trained a CNN (Frantz_net),
- I applied transfer learning to a pre-trained NN (InceptionResNetV2)
in order to evaluate the weather conditions in a (not yet classified) new picture. 

Performances of the networks have been evaluated.

The code has been written in Python, using Keras and Tensorflow libraries, on Colab.
